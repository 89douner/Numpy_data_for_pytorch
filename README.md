# numpy_data_for_pytorch
A training dataset generally is composed of class0, class1 and class3. Each class have dataset like 001.npy, 002. npy and so on. Sometimes, just a training numpy data consist of 3d (including all 2d (001.npy, 002.npy and so on) data). This code divides the 3d numpy data into all 2d numpy data.
